    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Hello everyone,</h2>
    <p>My name is Geetarth Kumar Gaire, and I am currently a student in Class 11th, Section B3 at GGIC. <br>One of my key interests is <b>web development</b>. <br> I enjoy designing and building websites, exploring various programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and keeping up with the latest trends in technology. When I'm not coding, I love experimenting with new design concepts and improving my technical skills.
<hr>
      I'm excited to share my enthusiasm for web development with others and collaborate on projects that allow me to apply and expand my knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Web development</h3>
<p>
  Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a range of activities and technologies to build everything from simple static web pages to complex, dynamic web-based applications. Web development can be broadly divided into two main areas: front-end development and back-end development.</p>
